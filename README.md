## Description

## User Journey

- When a user enter our website for the, they will see a landing page including the logo picture, a search bar, and two button: login button, and sign up button. Each take you to another page for login in or singing up.
- If the user doesn't have an account, he is going to sign up page which will create an account for him, then he will log in as an existing user.
- If the user logged in successfully, he will go to his profile page, where he can see the questions which were asked for him, and reply to them, each question takes one reply.
